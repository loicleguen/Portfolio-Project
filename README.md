## [Team Formation and roles definition](#-table-of-contents)
Our team began by getting to know each member’s background, strengths, and interests. We assigned initial responsibilities, including a temporary Project Manager to guide the early stages. Communication and collaboration guidelines were set up using tools like Slack or Discord. Each member took on a technical role—such as UI designer, backend developer, or frontend developer—based on their skills and preferences, ensuring balanced coverage of project needs. Stakeholders were identified and their influence on the project clarified where relevant.

The team is made up of four members:
- Pierre-Yves, who is specializing in cybersecurity.
- Jules, who is also specializing in cybersecurity.
- Valentin, who is in the first quarter of the fundamentals track.
- Loïc, who is in the third quarter of the fundamentals track.

We did not assign initial roles to individuals. We consider ourselves all as co-developers.

We meet regularly at school and, when needed, we have a Discord group for the four of us. We also have a WhatsApp group for communication with the clients.

Regarding the distribution of technical roles, since there are three distinct parts in this project, we decided that each of us — Pierre-Yves, Jules, and myself — would take responsibility for one of these parts. This means that all three of us would be both front-end and back-end developers.

This means that all three of us would be both front-end and back-end developers. As for Valentin, he is the team’s data analyst for the parts handled by Pierre-Yves and Jules, because for my part I will also be doing the data work so that my demo day is more complete.

The direct stakeholders are obviously the co-developers, therefore Pierre-Yves, Jules, Valentin, and myself.
The indirect stakeholders are the clients :
- Pierre, who is the financial director.
- Florian, who is a goalkeepers’ coach.
- Sebastien, who is an assistant coach.
- Lucas, who is a fitness coach.

## [Brainstorming and idea evaluation](#-table-of-contents)
You need to research project ideas, organize a brainstorming session using techniques such as mind mapping, SCAMPER, and “How Might We” questions. Then you must define criteria to evaluate the ideas, write a list of ideas with a short description for each one, and finally rank these ideas based on their feasibility, risks, and impact.

## [Decision and Refinement](#-table-of-contents)
You need to choose the final MVP idea, clearly explain the problem it solves, the solution it provides, the target users, and the type of application. You must also justify why you chose this idea, define 2 to 3 key features, specify what will be included or not included in the project, and identify the main risks along with how you will manage them.
