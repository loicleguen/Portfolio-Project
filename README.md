# Stage 1/ Team Formation, Brainstorming and MVP.

## [Team Formation and roles definition](#-table-of-contents)
Our team began by getting to know each member’s background, strengths, and interests. We assigned initial responsibilities, including a temporary Project Manager to guide the early stages. Communication and collaboration guidelines were set up using tools like Slack or Discord. Each member took on a technical role—such as UI designer, backend developer, or frontend developer—based on their skills and preferences, ensuring balanced coverage of project needs. Stakeholders were identified and their influence on the project clarified where relevant.

The team is made up of four members:
- Pierre-Yves, who is specializing in cybersecurity.
- Jules, who is also specializing in cybersecurity.
- Valentin, who is in the first quarter of the fundamentals track.
- Loïc, who is in the third quarter of the fundamentals track.

At the start, we held a meeting to introduce ourselves, discuss our skills, and set expectations. We agreed to work as co-developers, without assigning a permanent Project Manager, but one member coordinates meetings and deadlines when needed.

We established communication norms: regular in-person meetings at school, a Discord group for technical discussions, and WhatsApp for client communication. Decisions are made collectively, with everyone’s input considered.

Technical roles were distributed based on project needs and individual strengths. The project is divided into three main parts, each managed by Pierre-Yves, Jules, or Loïc, who handle both front-end and back-end tasks. Valentin acts as the data analyst for the parts managed by Pierre-Yves and Jules, while Loïc also manages data for his section to prepare for demo day.

The direct stakeholders are obviously the co-developers, therefore Pierre-Yves, Jules, Valentin, and myself.
The indirect stakeholders are the clients :
- Pierre, who is the financial director.
- Florian, who is a goalkeepers’ coach.
- Sebastien, who is an assistant coach.
- Lucas, who is a fitness coach.

## [Brainstorming and idea evaluation](#-table-of-contents)
You need to research project ideas, organize a brainstorming session using techniques such as mind mapping, SCAMPER, and “How Might We” questions. Then you must define criteria to evaluate the ideas, write a list of ideas with a short description for each one, and finally rank these ideas based on their feasibility, risks, and impact.


To identify our project direction, we first researched current industry trends and real-world challenges in sports analytics and team management. Each team member contributed ideas inspired by personal interests and client needs.

We organized a brainstorming session using mind mapping and “How Might We” questions to generate and connect ideas. We also applied the SCAMPER framework to explore how existing solutions could be improved or adapted.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Feasibility (can we build it with our skills and resources?)
- Potential impact (usefulness for users and stakeholders)
- Technical alignment (matches our expertise)
- Scalability (can the solution grow or be adapted?)

**Project Ideas:**
1. **Player Performance Dashboard**  
   A web app to track and visualize player statistics, training progress, and match performance.
2. **Team Communication Platform**  
   A tool for coaches and players to share updates, schedules, and feedback.
3. **Fitness & Injury Tracker**  
   An application to monitor player fitness levels and injury recovery, with alerts for coaches.

**Ranking:**
1. **Player Performance Dashboard**  
   - Feasibility: High  
   - Impact: High  
   - Risks: Manageable  
   - Chosen for its direct relevance to client needs and our technical strengths.
2. **Fitness & Injury Tracker**  
   - Feasibility: Medium  
   - Impact: Medium  
   - Risks: Data privacy, medical accuracy
3. **Team Communication Platform**  
   - Feasibility: High  
   - Impact: Medium  
   - Risks: Competes with existing solutions

After discussion, we selected the Player Performance Dashboard as our MVP due to its strong alignment with stakeholder needs and our team's expertise.

## [Decision and Refinement](#-table-of-contents)
You need to choose the final MVP idea, clearly explain the problem it solves, the solution it provides, the target users, and the type of application. You must also justify why you chose this idea, define 2 to 3 key features, specify what will be included or not included in the project, and identify the main risks along with how you will manage them.


### Selected MVP: Player Performance Dashboard

**Problem to solve:**  
Coaches and staff lack a centralized tool to track player progress, statistics, and fitness, making decision-making and training optimization more difficult.

**Solution provided:**  
A web application that visualizes and analyzes performance, training, and match data for each player, making it easier to monitor and improve both individual and team results.

**Target users:**  
Coaches, technical staff, players, and sports analysts.

**Type of application:**  
Web application accessible on computers and tablets.

**Why this idea?**  
This project directly addresses the needs expressed by our clients and leverages our team’s technical skills. It offers immediate value and impact, while other ideas were either too complex for the available timeframe or already covered by existing solutions.

**Key features and objectives:**
1. Visualization of individual and team statistics (SMART goal: allow coaches to access clear, personalized reports for each player).
2. Tracking training progress (SMART goal: generate progress charts for each player over a given period).
3. Alerts and notifications for outstanding performances or drops in form (SMART goal: automate alerts when key indicators change significantly).

**In-scope deliverables:**
- Interactive dashboard with data visualization.
- Import/export system for statistics.
- Alerts and notification module.

**Out-of-scope:**
- Advanced medical analysis or injury tracking.
- Internal messaging platform.
- Native mobile application.

**Risks and mitigation:**
- **Risk:** Lack of experience with some data visualization technologies.  
  **Mitigation:** Plan training sessions and use proven libraries.
- **Risk:** Difficulty collecting reliable data.  
  **Mitigation:** Work closely with clients to define clear data formats and sources.
- **Risk:** High workload for the team.  
  **Mitigation:** Prioritize essential features and schedule regular progress reviews.

### Sequence Diagrams Description

**1. User Authentication:**
- Coach enters credentials
- Frontend validates and sends to backend via Nginx
- Backend verifies credentials against database
- **Success case:** JWT token generated and returned to frontend, token stored for subsequent requests
- **Error cases:**
  - 404 Not Found: User doesn't exist
  - 401 Unauthorized: Wrong password
  - 400 Bad Request: Invalid input format

**2. CSV Data Import:**
- Coach uploads CSV file through frontend
- Frontend validates file format
- Backend receives and validates JWT token
- pandas library parses CSV data
- Data validated and transformed
- Each record inserted/updated in PostgreSQL
- Import log created for tracking
- **Success case:** Summary returned to coach with number of processed records
- **Error cases:**
  - 400 Bad Request: Invalid file format or data structure
  - 401 Unauthorized: Invalid or expired JWT token

**3. View Player Performance Dashboard:**
- Coach selects a player
- Backend validates JWT token
- Backend checks Redis cache first (performance optimization)
- If cache miss, queries PostgreSQL for all player data
- Data aggregated and cached for future requests
- Frontend receives data and renders dashboard with charts
- **Success case:** Coach views comprehensive player statistics
- **Error cases:**
  - 404 Not Found: Player doesn't exist
  - 401 Unauthorized: Invalid or expired JWT token

These sequence diagrams illustrate the main interactions between system components for critical MVP functionalities, including proper error handling and HTTP status codes.

## [External and Internal APIs](#-table-of-contents)

### External APIs

The project currently does not integrate external third-party APIs. All data processing is done internally using:

1. **pandas** - For CSV/Excel file parsing and data manipulation (internal library, not an external API)
2. **matplotlib/seaborn** - For data visualization and graph generation (internal library)

**Future Considerations:**
- **Email Service API** (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) - For sending performance alert notifications
- **Cloud Storage API** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) - For storing uploaded files and generated reports
- **Authentication Provider** (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Auth) - For enhanced authentication management

### Internal API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api` (development) | `https://yourdomain.com/api` (production)

**Authentication:** JWT Bearer Token (for protected endpoints)

### API Design Principles

**1. RESTful Design:**
- Resources are nouns (countries, academies, teams, players)
- HTTP methods match actions (GET=read, POST=create, PUT=update, DELETE=delete)
- Consistent URL structure

**2. Status Codes:**
- `200 OK` - Successful GET, PUT, DELETE
- `201 Created` - Successful POST
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid input
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing/invalid authentication
- `404 Not Found` - Resource doesn't exist
- `409 Conflict` - Duplicate resource (e.g., country name already exists)

**3. Response Format:**
- All responses are JSON
- Consistent error format:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message description"
}
```

**4. Authentication:**
- Protected endpoints require JWT token in Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**5. Validation:**
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Type checking enforced by FastAPI
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`

---

|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/auth/login` | User authentication |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | User logout |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Get current user info |

## [SCM and QA Strategies](#-table-of-contents)

### Source Control Management (SCM)

**Version Control:** Git + GitHub

**Branching Strategy:**
- `main` - Production-ready code (protected)
- `develop` - Integration branch for development
- `feature/*` - New features (e.g., `feature/player-dashboard`)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

**Workflow:**
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Develop and commit regularly with clear messages
3. Push and create Pull Request to `develop`
4. Code review by at least 1 team member
5. Merge after approval and passing tests

**Commit Convention:**
```
feat: add new feature
fix: bug correction
docs: documentation update
test: add or update tests
```

**Code Review Requirements:**
- Minimum 1 approval
- All tests must pass
- No merge conflicts
- Code follows style guidelines

---

### Quality Assurance (QA)

**Testing Strategy:**

**1. Unit Tests**
- **Backend:** `pytest` (coverage target: 80%)
  - Test individual functions, parsers, models
- **Frontend:** `Jest` + `React Testing Library` (coverage target: 70%)
  - Test components, hooks, utilities

**2. Integration Tests**
- **Backend:** `pytest` + `TestClient` for API endpoints
- **Frontend:** `Cypress` for user flows and navigation

**3. Manual Testing**
- CSV import with various file sizes
- PDF report generation
- Chart visualizations
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Testing Tools:**
| Layer | Frontend | Backend |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Unit | Jest | pytest |
| Integration | Cypress | pytest + TestClient |
| Linting | ESLint | pylint / black |

**CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
```
Pull Request → Automated Tests → Code Review → Merge
     ↓
develop branch → Deploy to Staging → Manual QA
     ↓
main branch → Deploy to Production
```

**Quality Metrics:**
- Code coverage: ≥80% backend, ≥70% frontend
- API response time: <200ms average
- All tests pass before deployment

**Environments:**
- **Development:** Local Docker containers
- **Staging:** Cloud deployment for testing
- **Production:** Live environment
