## [Team Formation and roles definition](#table-of-contents)
Our team began by getting to know each member’s background, strengths, and interests. We assigned initial responsibilities, including a temporary Project Manager to guide the early stages. Communication and collaboration guidelines were set up using tools like Slack or Discord. Each member took on a technical role—such as UI designer, backend developer, or frontend developer—based on their skills and preferences, ensuring balanced coverage of project needs. Stakeholders were identified and their influence on the project clarified where relevant.

**The team is made up of four members:**
- Pierre-Yves, who is specializing in cybersecurity.
- Jules, who is also specializing in cybersecurity.
- Valentin, who is in the first quarter of the fundamentals track.
- Loïc, who is in the third quarter of the fundamentals track.

We did not assign initial roles to individuals. We consider ourselves all as co-developers.

We meet regularly at school and, when needed, we have a Discord group for the four of us. We also have a WhatsApp group for communication with the clients.
